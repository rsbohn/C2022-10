October 2022 Challenge: web-displayio "fantastic telegram"

See it live: [Fantastic Telegram](https://rsbohn.github.io/C2022-10/)

One thing that is difficult with CircuitPython is sharing your displayio projects on the web. You either take a photo with your phone (hello moire) or do a screenshot, in which you discover the complications of writing files to flash.

The goal of this October 2022 Challenge is to put CircuitPython displayio code in a web page. Build something close enough to displayio that you can move from device to web page easily. Rather than a static screenshot you can have a live displayio application.
